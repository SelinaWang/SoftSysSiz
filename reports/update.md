# Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit
## Software Systems Project 2 Proposal

## Project Goals

The goal of our project is explore the C stack vulnerabilities and smashing the C stack for fun (and maybe profit). The lower bound of our project is to complete all the exercises in this cyber security guide and gain a good understanding of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Our stretch goals include looking into some common cyber security tools that are listed on the guide, as well as looking at heap and socket vulnerabilities.

## Learning Goals

Our learning goals include exploring the weaknesses of C, as well as what makes software vulnerable and how a software engineer could prevent it. We also hope to tap into the wild world of cyber security and how attacks can be created and addressed.

## Resources

We plan to use an online guide linked (http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html) from the SoftSys project resources page. This guide also provides an extensive list of external resources that are related to the project. We found some additional resources including:

- https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/
- http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/hh-10.html


## Current Status

We finished conducting research into the history and the different types of cyber security attacks specifically linked to the C stack in order to gain a better understanding of the context. Our next step is to complete the first few exercises provided in our main resource.
