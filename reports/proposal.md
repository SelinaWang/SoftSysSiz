## Project Goals

The goal of our project is explore the C stack vulnerabilities and smashing the C stack for fun (and maybe profit). The lower bound of our project is to complete all the exercises in this cyber security guide and gain a good understanding of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Our stretch goals include looking into some common cyber security tools that are listed on the guide.

## Learning Goals

Our learning goals include learning C more intimately, especially the C stack. We also hope to tap into the wild world of cyber security and how attacks can be created and addressed.

## Resources

We plan to use an online guide linked (http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html) from the SoftSys project resources page. This guide also provides an extensive list of external resources that are related to the project. We believe we won't need additional resources at this point.

## First Step

We would like to do more research into the history and the different types of cyber security attacks specifically linked to the C stack in order to gain a better understanding of the context. Our first step to complete the first few exercises by reading through first chapter of the guide and set up our environment. We will keep completing these exercises and make steady progress on a weekly basis. With this plan, pushing the exercise solutions to our github repo is how we might define "done". We plan to collaborate on these first steps together (because it makes sense to start out on the same page).
